# `duokeykms` Seal

The DuoKey seal configures Vault to use DuoKey as the seal wrapping mechanism. 
The DuoKey seal is activated by one of the following:

- The presence of a `seal "duokeykms"` block in Vault's configuration file.
- The presence of the environment variable `VAULT_SEAL_TYPE` set to `duokeykms`.
  If enabling via environment variable, all other required values specific to
  DuoKey (i.e. `DUOKEY_KEY_ID`, etc.) must be also supplied, as
  well as all other DuoKey-related environment variables that lends to successful
  authentication (i.e. `DUOKEY_TENANT_ID`, etc.).

## `duokeykms` Example

This example shows configuring DuoKey seal through the Vault
configuration file by providing all the required values:

```hcl
seal "duokeykms" {
 issuer = "https://duokey-cockpit-staging.azurewebsites.net"
 client_id = "client"
 client_secret = "5353347c-f5d1-44c0-80db-16261628d36c"
 vault_id = "688cae61-6098-488a-a2dd-a9983c6111bf"
 tenant_id = "1"
 username = "admin"
 password = "C03CXtU11sb3Zif1"
 scope = "default-api"
 key_id = "a5e32505-7df3-4097-b86c-47f4f533ab46",
 basepath = "https://duokey-cockpit-staging.azurewebsites.net"
 encryptroute = "/api/services/app/Keys/CreateEncryptRequest"
 decryptroute = "/api/services/app/Keys/CreateDecryptRequest"
}
